Dfam release 1.2  HMM file downloaded on 28/10/14.
Refer to relnotes.txt for more details on release. 


***** 27-OCT-16 UPDATE
Noticed the Dfam folder (401) was too large for GitHub upload.
Am now hosting on my Google Drive as an intact tarball.
When you download this, remove the existing 401 directory, then access the directory with this command:

tar -cxvf 401_Dfam_nucl_pHMMs.tar.gz
